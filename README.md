This is a package that allows you to create an interactive select tree field based on relationships in your Laravel / Filament application. It provides a convenient way to build hierarchical selection dropdowns with various customization options.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require codewithdennis/filament-select-tree
```

```bash
php artisan filament:assets
```

## Features

- Dark Mode: It seamlessly supports both Filament's light and dark modes out of the box.
- Search: Searching is fully supported, and it seamlessly searches through all levels within the tree structure.
- BelongsTo Integration: Establish connections within your data effortlessly.
- BelongsToMany Integration: Simplify the management of complex relationships through BelongsToMany integration.

__🔍 One thing I've noticed is that it runs a lot of queries, mainly because of its recursive design. Working on reducing this in the upcoming updates to make it faster!__

## Usage

Import the `SelectTree` class from the `CodeWithDennis\FilamentSelectTree` namespace

```PHP
use CodeWithDennis\FilamentSelectTree\SelectTree;
```

Create a tree based on a 'BelongsToMany' relationship

```PHP
SelectTree::make('categories')
    ->relationship('categories', 'name', 'parent_id', function ($query) {
        return $query;
    })
```

Create a tree based on a 'BelongsTo' relationship

```PHP
SelectTree::make('category_id')
    ->relationship('category', 'name', 'parent_id', function ($query) {
        return $query;
    })
```

Set a custom placeholder when no items are selected

```PHP
->placeholder(__('Please select a category'))
```

Enable the selection of groups

```PHP
->enableBranchNode()
```

Customize the label when there are zero search results

```PHP
->emptyLabel(__('Oops, no results have been found!'))
```

Display the count of children alongside the group's name

```PHP
->withCount()
```


You can adjust the count's position to either `Alignment::Left` or `Alignment::Right`.

```PHP
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

->withCount(position: Alignment::Right)
```

Keep the dropdown open at all times

```PHP
->alwaysOpen()
```

Set nodes as dependent

```PHP
->independent(false)
```

Expand the tree with selected values (only works if field is dependent)

```PHP
->expandSelected(false)
```

Set the parent's null value to -1, allowing you to use -1 as a sentinel value (default = null)

```PHP
->parentNullValue(-1)
```

All groups will be opened to this level

```PHP
->defaultOpenLevel(2)
```

Specify the list's force direction. Options include: auto (default), top, and bottom.

```PHP
->directon('top')
```

Display individual leaf nodes instead of the main group when all leaf nodes are selected

```PHP
->grouped(false)
```

Hide the clearable icon

```PHP
->clearable(false)
```

Activate the search functionality

```PHP
->searchable();
```
